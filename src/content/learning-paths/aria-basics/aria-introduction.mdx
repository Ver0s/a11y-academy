# Introduction to ARIA

**ARIA** (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes that
define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people
with disabilities who use assistive technologies.

## What is ARIA?

ARIA provides additional semantic information about web elements that may not be conveyed through standard HTML. It helps bridge the gap between complex modern web applications and assistive technologies like screen readers.

### When to Use ARIA

ARIA should be used when:

- Native HTML semantics aren't sufficient
- Creating dynamic content that updates
- Building complex interactive widgets
- Managing focus and live regions
- Expressing relationships between elements

**Important:** The first rule of ARIA is not to use ARIA if native HTML
elements can provide the same functionality. Always prefer semantic HTML
when possible.

## Key ARIA Concepts

ARIA works through three main concepts:

1. **Roles** - Define what an element is or does
2. **Properties** - Express characteristics of elements
3. **States** - Define current conditions of elements

### Common Use Cases

- Making custom buttons accessible
- Managing dynamic content updates
- Creating accessible modal dialogs
- Building complex navigation menus
- Implementing form validation feedback

## Benefits of Using ARIA

When used correctly, ARIA:

- Makes complex interfaces accessible
- Improves screen reader navigation
- Provides better context for users
- Enhances interactive experiences
- Supports modern web applications

Remember that ARIA can't fix poor HTML structure. Start with semantic HTML,
then enhance with ARIA only when necessary.

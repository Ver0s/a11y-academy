# Introduction to Web Accessibility

**Web accessibility** (often abbreviated as **a11y**) is the practice of
making websites and applications usable by people with disabilities. This
includes visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities.

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means ensuring that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and applications. It's about creating inclusive digital experiences that work for everyone.

### Who Benefits from Accessibility?

While accessibility is essential for people with disabilities, it actually benefits everyone:

- **People with disabilities** - Screen reader users, people with motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, etc.
- **Aging populations** - People experiencing age-related changes in vision, hearing, or dexterity
- **Situational limitations** - Someone with a broken arm, in a bright environment, or using a mobile device
- **Everyone** - Clear navigation, good contrast, and logical structure improve usability for all

## The Business Case for Accessibility

Making your website accessible isn't just the right thing to do, it makes business sense:

### Legal Requirements

- **ADA compliance** in the United States
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** is the international standard
- **Section 508** for government websites
- **European Accessibility Act** for EU countries

### Market Reach

Over **1 billion people** worldwide have a disability. That's a significant
market segment that inaccessible websites exclude.

### SEO Benefits

Many accessibility practices improve search engine optimization:

- Proper heading structure
- Descriptive link text
- Alternative text for images
- Semantic HTML markup

## Common Accessibility Barriers

Let's look at some common barriers that prevent people from accessing web content:

### Visual Barriers

- Poor color contrast
- Missing alternative text for images
- Text that can't be resized
- Information conveyed only through color

### Auditory Barriers

- Videos without captions
- Audio content without transcripts
- No visual indicators for sound-based alerts

### Motor Barriers

- Lack of keyboard navigation
- Small click targets
- Time-limited interactions
- Complex gestures required

### Cognitive Barriers

- Complex navigation
- Inconsistent layouts
- Unclear language
- Lack of error prevention and correction

## WCAG Guidelines Overview

The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** provide the foundation for web accessibility standards. They're organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive.

- Provide text alternatives for images
- Offer captions and transcripts for multimedia
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations

### 2. Operable

User interface components must be operable.

- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Don't use content that causes seizures
- Help users navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable

Information and operation of UI must be understandable.

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough for interpretation by assistive technologies.

- Maximize compatibility with current and future assistive tools
- Use valid, semantic HTML
- Ensure content works across different browsers and devices

**WCAG 2.1 AA** is the current standard that most organizations aim for. It
strikes a balance between accessibility and implementation feasibility.

## Getting Started with Accessibility

Here are some immediate steps you can take to improve accessibility:

### Quick Wins

1. **Add alt text** to all images
2. **Use proper heading structure** (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
3. **Ensure good color contrast** (4.5:1 for normal text)
4. **Make sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible**
5. **Use descriptive link text** instead of "click here"

### Testing Tools

- **Screen readers** - NVDA (free), JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Automated testing** - axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse
- **Manual testing** - Keyboard navigation, color contrast analyzers

**Exercise:** Open your browser's developer tools and run a Lighthouse audit
on any website. Look at the Accessibility score and note what issues it
finds.

## What's Next?

In the following lessons, we'll dive deeper into specific accessibility topics:

- Understanding how screen readers work
- Implementing keyboard navigation
- Creating accessible forms
- Using ARIA attributes effectively
- Testing your implementations

**Remember, accessibility is not a one-time fixâ€”it's an ongoing commitment to inclusive design.**

## Key Takeaways

- Web accessibility ensures people with disabilities can use websites and applications
- It benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities
- WCAG 2.1 AA is the current standard to aim for
- Start with quick wins: alt text, headings, contrast, and keyboard navigation
- Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time task

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfection from day one. Start with the basics
and gradually improve your accessibility implementation over time.
